<h1>A Digital Pound for the UK: Yes or No?</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project, completed as part of my BSc in Investment and Financial Risk Management at Bayes Business School, explores whether the <b>Digital Pound (D£)</b>, a potential UK Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), is justified.  

Using <b>YouGov survey data</b> collected on behalf of the Bank of England (BoE), I analysed consumer and SME payment behaviours, attitudes towards cash and digital payments, and openness to new technologies. The project complements this data with a review of international CBDC experiences and BoE/HM Treasury consultation documents.  

The research concludes that while there are compelling reasons to continue the design stage of the Digital Pound, current evidence is insufficient to fully justify its launch.

<h2>Tools and Methods Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Excel</b> (survey table analysis, demographic weighting, pivot tables, charting)  
- <b>Qualitative Research</b> (comparative analysis of launched CBDCs, review of policy papers)  
- <b>Data Source:</b> YouGov Consumer & SME Payment Behaviour Surveys (commissioned by BoE, 2023)  
- <b>Secondary Sources:</b> IMF, BIS, Bank of England, HM Treasury, and academic research

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

- **Goal:** Assess whether demand for a UK retail CBDC exists, and if so, what design features would encourage adoption.  
- **Stakeholders:** Bank of England, HM Treasury, UK consumers, SMEs, commercial banks.  
- **Key issues:**  
  - Declining but still significant cash usage  
  - Consumer inertia (rarely switching providers)  
  - Trust, privacy, and security concerns  
  - SMEs reflecting consumer preferences in payment acceptance  
  - Risks of deposit substitution away from commercial banks

<h2>Data</h2>

- **YouGov Consumer Survey** – 25 questions on payment behaviours, savings, switching, technology adoption.  
- **YouGov SME Survey** – 15 questions on accepted/preferred payment methods, bill/salary payments, openness to innovation.  
- **BoE Consultation Papers** – Digital Pound design criteria (inclusion, privacy, resilience, innovation).  
- **International CBDC Cases** – Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria’s eNaira, Jamaica’s Jam-Dex, Eastern Caribbean DCash.

<h2>Methodology</h2>

1. <b>Literature Review</b>  
   - Reviewed launched CBDCs to identify drivers of adoption and causes of failure (e.g. lack of marketing, poor infrastructure, privacy concerns).  

2. <b>Consumer Data Analysis</b>  
   - Analysed demographics, internet usage, and banking habits.  
   - Explored payment method preferences (cash vs debit vs online).  
   - Examined switching reluctance and reasons for non-adoption.  

3. <b>SME Data Analysis</b>  
   - Reviewed accepted vs preferred payment methods.  
   - Analysed salary and bill payment practices.  
   - Considered SME reliance on consumer demand.  

4. <b>Design Criteria Mapping</b>  
   - Mapped survey findings against BoE/HM Treasury principles (privacy, resilience, inclusion, interoperability).  

5. <b>Findings Synthesis</b>  
   - Integrated consumer/SME survey results with international lessons to form policy recommendations.

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>Consumers</b>:  
  - 38% use cash weekly; 90% want cash retained.  
  - Debit cards dominate payments (69% in-store, 48% online).  
  - Trust, safety, and privacy rated >90% importance in choosing accounts/payment methods.  
  - 63% have never switched bank providers → strong inertia.  
  - Many wait for others to adopt technology before trying it (46%).  

- <b>SMEs</b>:  
  - Strong preference for online bank transfers (56%).  
  - 85% of salaries and 92% of bills paid digitally.  
  - Top priorities: speed, security, reliability, traceability.  
  - Payment acceptance aligns closely with consumer demand.  

- <b>Overall</b>:  
  - Likely substitution away from deposits, not cash → risk of disintermediation.  
  - Demand is more about <i>trust, usability, and awareness</i> than technology.  
  - Reluctance to switch is a major barrier; marketing and education would be essential.  

---

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- Continue with the <b>design stage</b> but delay launch until demand is clearer.  
- <b>Marketing & education campaigns</b> to raise awareness across demographics.  
- <b>Offline functionality</b> to ensure inclusion of non-digital users.  
- <b>Holding limits</b> to mitigate deposit drain risk.  
- <b>Privacy safeguards</b> legislated to ensure public trust.  
- Ensure the Digital Pound <b>complements cash</b> rather than replacing it.  

---

<h2>Limitations</h2>

- Survey-based analysis (self-reported behaviour).  
- Limited empirical CBDC case studies globally.  
- No econometric modelling (focus on qualitative + descriptive insights).  

---

<h2>Future Work</h2>

- Direct surveys on <i>demand for a Digital Pound</i>, not just payment habits.  
- Scenario modelling of bank disintermediation under different adoption levels.  
- Study demographic subgroups in greater detail (age, region, disability).  
- Explore remuneration and tokenisation design options.
